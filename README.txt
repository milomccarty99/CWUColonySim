## by Milo McCarty
Example code for running CWUColonySim.cpp:


`g++ CWUColonySim.cpp -pthread -Wall -o Lab3;`

`./Lab3 3 2 10 20 ; `

The executable needs exactly 4 additional integer arguments. The first argument is the number of team members on Team A. The second argument is the number of team members on Team B. The third argument is number of rows in the play area. The fourth argument is the number of columns in the play area.
